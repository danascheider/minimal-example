      <h4>ABOUT TEST RUBY PDX</h4>
      <p>Test Ruby PDX is Portland's only user group focused on Ruby testing from a developer's perspective. Our monthly meetings offer developers of all levels an opportunity to meet other developers, ask questions, and hear talks about Ruby testing tools and practices. We are still a brand new user group and will be announcing our first meeting in the next couple weeks. <a href='http://twitter.com/danascheider'>Follow our organizer on Twitter</a> to find out more!</p><br /><br />
      <h5>THE RUBY TESTING TOOLBOX</h5>
      <p>The Ruby language has a vibrant ecosystem for testing! In addition to a variety of great test frameworks, friendly, fun-to-use tools abound for creating fixtures and mocks, running tests against multiple versions of your gemset, and running headless browser tests, to name just a few. At our meetings, you can learn more about which tools are available, which make sense for your project, and the best ways to integrate the ones you ultimately choose.</p><br /><br />
      <h5>INTERMEDIATE & ADVANCED TESTING TOPICS</h5>
      <p>Do books and tutorials leave you with more questions than answers, or do they not address your use case? If so, come to test Ruby PDX for guidance beyond the basics that most tutorials offer. Plus, we bet the tutorials didn't give you free pizza.</p><br /><br />
      <h5>DEVELOPER FOCUSED</h5>
      <p>QA is great and all, but you don't want to wait for them to figure out if your code works! Test Ruby PDX is 100% developer focused (although everyone is totally welcome, of course!).</p><br /><br />
